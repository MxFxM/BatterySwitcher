# BatterySwitcher
Battery switcher for my battery charger to charge multiple lipos one after the other without manual un- and replugging.

Hardware schematic and layout done in KiCad.

Software will most likely use an Arduino or ESP8266 but this is not decided yet.
The hardware has to be at least 80% done until I will decide on a microcontroller.
